# Uniform

Uniform is a CSS/SCSS framework that is designed to be modular and streamline
the development of responsive/fluid UIs.

This is accomplished through the use of _flexbox_ for layout, combined with a
_typography-based_ layout system that takes the guesswork out of writing CSS to
match a design.
